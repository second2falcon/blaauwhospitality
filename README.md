I thought, if I was going to mess around with HTML, CSS and JS for a static webpage deployed on the internet, it might as well have the possibility of ever being actually useful (tho I still doubt that). </br>
My father has a company, which still has no website but is operating just fine, and I thought I might as well ***try*** to make one. </br>
So far it hasn't been going too great because my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS is very limited, but with Google, Reddit, StackOverflow, SpiceWorks and different AIs (GH Copilot and ChatGPT) I am getting there. </br>

I don't expect this website to ever become the companies actual webpage, mostly because it would be quite embarassing for me (it feels that way atleast) as everyone in the family and friends circle knows me as the IT guy who can solve basically every problem.
